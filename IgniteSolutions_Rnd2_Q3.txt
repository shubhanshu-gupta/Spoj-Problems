/*Q3) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By
starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even­valued terms. In other words you need to find the sum of all even
fibonacci numbers below four million.
